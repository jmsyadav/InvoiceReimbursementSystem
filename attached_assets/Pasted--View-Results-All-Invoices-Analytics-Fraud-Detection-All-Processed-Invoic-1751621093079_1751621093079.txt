📄 INV-20250704-002 - Seema

Employee: Seema

Date: 2025-07-04

Amount: ₹141.0

Type: general

Status: Partially Reimbursed

✅ No Fraud

Reason: The invoice is for a cab ride, which falls under the 'Travel Expenses' category. The amount of ₹141 is within the daily office cab allowance of ₹150. However, the policy does not specify a limit for the total reimbursement of cab rides per trip, so the full amount of ₹141 can be reimbursed. Nevertheless, the policy does not explicitly state that cab rides are reimbursable for personal reasons, but since the employee is using the cab for work-related purposes, it can be considered reimbursable. Therefore, the reimbursement status is 'Partially Reimbursed' because the policy does not provide a clear limit for cab ride reimbursement per trip.

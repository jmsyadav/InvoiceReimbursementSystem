To find the total reimbursed amount, I will add up the "Reimbursed Amount" field for each invoice.

Invoice 1 has a reimbursed amount of Rs 88.00, Invoice 2 has a reimbursed amount of Rs 90.00, Invoice 3 has a reimbursed amount of Rs 88.00, and Invoice 4 has a reimbursed amount of Rs 90.00.

Adding these amounts together, the total reimbursed amount is Rs 356.00.

Invoice 1 is fully reimbursed for Rs 90.00, Invoice 2 is fully reimbursed for Rs 88.00, Invoice 3 is fully reimbursed for Rs 88.00, and Invoice 4 is fully reimbursed for Rs 90.00.

total invoices by Rani?

To find the total invoices by Rani, I will look at the employee name in each invoice.

Invoice 1 has Rani as the employee, Invoice 2 also has Rani as the employee, Invoice 3 has Rani as the employee, and Invoice 4 has Rani as the employee.

Since all four invoices have Rani as the employee, the total number of invoices by Rani is 4.

All seven invoices have a status of Declined, which means they were not reimbursed.

Which employee invoices were declined?

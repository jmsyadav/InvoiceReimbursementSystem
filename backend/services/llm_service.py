        You are analyzing an employee expense invoice against a company reimbursement policy.

        {policy_text}
        
        **INVOICE TEXT:**
        {invoice_text}
        
        **STRUCTURED INVOICE DATA:**
        Employee: {invoice_data.get('employee_name', 'Unknown')}

        Description: {invoice_data.get('description', 'N/A')}
        
        **ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
        1. Carefully review the invoice against the reimbursement policy
        2. Determine if the expense is eligible for reimbursement
        3. Consider factors like:
           - Expense category and limits
           - Required documentation
           - Business purpose
           - Approval requirements
           - Date validity
        
        **REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
        Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
        {{
            "status": "[Fully Reimbursed|Partially Reimbursed|Declined]",
            "reason": "Detailed explanation of the decision with specific policy references"

        **REIMBURSEMENT CATEGORIES:**
        - "Fully Reimbursed": The entire invoice amount is reimbursable according to policy
        - "Partially Reimbursed": Only a portion meets policy requirements (specify amount/percentage)
        - "Declined": The invoice does not meet policy requirements
        
        Provide a thorough analysis with specific policy references and clear reasoning.
